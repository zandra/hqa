# QA Headquarters
 
## Context

HQA is an encyclopedic (i.e 'wiki-esque') internal tool developed for the QA department at my work and with QA in mind. I originally conceived it as a sort of fusion (in at least two ways) of two familiar documentation types in the tech world: the knowledge base familiar to SAAS (software as a service) users and the (often exemplary) technical docs familiar to
web developers.

A knowledge base, at least a good one, acts as a detailed and comprehensive instruction manual for the application's end users, providing setup and usage guides - generally organized as articles - for each page, feature, setting, etc.
Technical docs do the same for their end users, web developers and software engineers, focusing on their subjects' technical implementation and use. The role of QA bridges these concerns; a good tester must have a working knowledge of both sides of an application, both the technical implementation and the navigation and use of each feature.
